# Digit Recognizer

Scripts for the "Digit Recognizer" competition at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer).

Three learning algorithms were tried for this competition:

- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN);
- Support Vector Machines (SVM) with RBF kernel;
- Deep Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet).

The ConvNet classifier achieved the best results, with a classification accuracy of **0.99271** in the test set.

Last time I checked, I was top 9% in the leaderboard with this score.
