# Digit Recognizer

Scripts for the "Digit Recognizer" competition at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer).

Three learning algorithms were tried for this competition:

- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN);
- Support Vector Machines (SVM) with RBF kernel;
- Deep Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet).

The ConvNet classifier achieved the best result in the test set, with a classification accuracy of **0.99271** (top 9% in the leaderboard).
