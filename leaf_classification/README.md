# Leaf Classification

Notebooks and scripts for the "Leaf Classification" competition at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/leaf-classification).

For now, a Logistic Regression algorithm is being used to train the predictive model. Helped by some feature scaling, it achieved a multiclass loss of **0.02983** in the test set.

Last time I checked, I was top 17% in the leaderboard with this score. I'm still willing to improve this result.
