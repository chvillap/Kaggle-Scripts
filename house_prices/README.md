# House Prices

Notebooks and scripts for the "House Prices" competition at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

For now, a combination of LASSO and XGBoost regression is being used to train the predictive model. Helped by some feature engineering, it achieved a root mean squared logarithmic error of **0.12176** in the test set.

Last time I checked, I was top 25% in the leaderboard with this score. I'm still willing to improve this result.
